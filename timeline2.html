					<div class="date">26 SEPT 2018</div>
				  <p>It was a rainy fall evening at the Hibernian in Raleigh. After I made an on-stage appearance singing <i>You are My Sunshine</i> with the band, you introduced yourself and we chatted about music and work over the sound of one of our favorite bluegrass songs: Rye Whiskey.</p>

					<div class="date">9 OCT 2018</div>
				  <p>Our first date was at NCMA for <i>The Beyond: Georgia O'Keeffe and Contemporary Art</i> followed by drinks at Boxcar and a walk to the capitol building. Nothing has been more fitting than the words of O'Keeffe that inspired the exhibit that night: "I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life - and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do."</p>

					<h2>Rainy in San Diego</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="date">31 DEC 2018</div>
				  <p>It was my first trip to San Diego and I don't think I had ever been more nervous or excited for anything. I finally got to see your world and meet your people and while the weather was subpar, the people certainly were not.</p>

				  <p>We said "I love you" for the first time on Valentine's Day of 2019. I still have the card with the poem you wrote me. You were so excited to give it to me you made me pull over on the way to work and you surprised me in the parking lot at Dix Park. I still love you more than yesterday...and I loved you a lot yesterday.</p>

				  <h2>Hosts with the most</h2>
				  <p>One of the first big gatherings we put on together was Easter Brunchâ€”a garden party with a mimosa bar, many of our favorite people and an Easter egg hunt. I realized that I didn't have to do it on my own anymore. You share my vision for hosting and are as extra as I am when it comes to going above and beyond to make an experience more special.</p>

					<h2>Taking Flight</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="date">9 NOV 2019</div>
				  <p>I think I may have been more excited about this than you were, maybe because I didn't have to cope with the anxiety of potentially crashing us. It was a big moment to see you fly a plane for the first time and I loved how it pushed you outside of your comfort zone as we circled Jordan Lake. You are so fierce in your pursuit of new experiences, even when they come with nerves.</p>

				  <blockquote>You walked me around your college town and I finally got to see all the places the stories came from. I loved imagining what it must have been like and I'm so thankful for all that you got to experience there because it made you who you are today and I'm so in love with that man.</blockquote>

					<h2>Happy New Year?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="date">1 JAN 2020</div>
				  <p>Ringing in the new year with you is one of my favorite memories. An evening at a fancy party with all of our friends followed by a morning of brunch-making and an afternoon in the park. Big moments, small moments and all the ones in between remind me how lucky I am to share this life with you.</p>

				  <p>All I have to say is I got to go on the trip of my dreams with the man of my dreams. I enjoyed every exhausted minute, every sweaty afternoon, every not-so-spicy panang curry, every beachside pina colada and just about every experience except riding that stupid scooter.</p>

					<h2>Quarantime on the Road</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="date">MARCH-JUNE 2020</div>
				  <p>I feel confident that if we can be around each other 24/7 for several months, we can handle anything. Not to mention we spent a whole month of that time in a van. From Raleigh to Dallas to Santa Fe to Denver to St. Louis to Nashville to Las Vegas to San Diego, I saw time and time again that you are not only the man of my dreams, but my best friend. You're the best adventure buddy I've ever had even when we're up at 3 a.m. yelling at each other over a couple mice. </p>

					<div class="date">22 AUG 2020</div>
				  <p>I spent so much of my childhood on the farm in Michigan and it meant the world to me that you wanted to see it and made it happen. I feel more understood and like I can talk about those memories and you get that part of me now.</p>
