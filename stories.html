              <h2>Our first hello</h2>
              <p>"Where'd you learn to sing like that?"<br><br>
			  When I went out for an after-work pedicure in my sweater and sandals, I didn't expect to meet someone who would change my entire life trajectory—someone who would one day know me better than anyone ever had and who would love me more than anyone ever would—someone who would make my life better, richer, fuller in ways I hadn't even thought to hope for. I didn't expect to meet that someone, but I did—the night I met you.</p>
              <p>I'll never forget that night. Dark, rainy, but full of life as the bluegrass band drove the mood up in Hibernian. You were there, a cute blonde man sporting a West Coast look that was so obviously foreign. I saw you well before you approached, but judged the content by the cover and wrote you off. Even after you introduced yourself, I was wary—sure that this handsome Californian could not be genuinely interested in the drowned rat of a girl that had dodged into the bar during the storm. Little did I know you would prove every suspicion misguided, every judgment misinformed. In the mean time, I was flattered by your interest and remember consciously guarding my expectations in the following days, careful not to get my hopes up for fear of who you were not. Your persistance that night was mere foreboding of the perseverance you would exhibit the next few weeks—the perseverance that would contradict my expectations and woo my cynical spirit into the love of a lifetime.</p>

              <h2>Our first kiss</h2>
              <p>I was determined not to kiss you on our first date. I set the rule for myself going into the night because I needed to establish my thoughts before my feelings. I still remember your reaction after the second time I swerved a kiss that night—it was like you'd never met someone who had that boundary for first dates. Needless to say, it didn't last long.</p>
              <p>Two days later, Hurricane Michael threatened Raleigh with some nasty winds and an onslaught of precipitation. Both of our offices sent us home midday. We were texting when you invited me over to work from your house. I could think of no better way to get to know someone without the pressure of mutually-assured attention. That being said, I had no idea it would go the way it did. I don't know if you were sneaky or just conveniently prepared, but I had never before seen someone transition so seamlessly from a work session to a spontaneous date night with the added complication of a power outage. From the perfectly tender meat to the candles and placemats to the evening walk on weather-beaten streets, you turned up the romance in all of the best ways. It was the perfect storm. How could I <i>not</i> have kissed you? You are romance and adventure, thoughtfulness and sponteneity, safety and intrigue—and my life is all the better because of it.</p>

              <h2>Our first trip</h2>
              <p>While we've now been on countless trips to far off places, our first trip together holds a special place in my heart. We had only been going out two weeks and I thought you were joking the first time you asked to come. By the fifth time, I understood your sincerity, but thought you were crazy to be so confident in your desire to come with me for a whole weekend. As I drove out of town, I had this unsettled feeling, like I was missing something. I had just driven over Jordan Lake when I started texting you about coming. "Do you still want to come? How soon could you be ready? Can I pick you up in 40 minutes?" </p>
